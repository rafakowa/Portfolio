Hi, my name is Rafa≈Ç and I would like to introduce you my analysis of company based on example database "AdwentureWorks2022".
In this project I want to show my knowledge of using SQL language, Power BI and Power Query. I divided that analysis on 5 parts.

First one is sales, where I want show difference between online and stationary sales, sales in time, and best or worst products.
You can also find net sales from different regions of our customers.

Second part of this project shows warehouse analysis. You can find there warehouse filling level, % of profit in product groups,
products on warehouse sections. Also I add some new colums to calculate estimated costs and estimated revenues, what depends from
actual warehouse filling level and safety stock level.

Next part shows clients of the company. Here you can see how big are gross sales on different countries and states, who was in the 
top 10 customers with total sales, and look at stats between individual or retail customers.

In the fourth part I would like to present production losses to show where company should increase their standards to save money and increase incomes.
You can see how many products was scrapped, their costs to company and loosed incomes. Also can see what product lines should be better, what effect does 
the length of production have on production costs or how are shaped loosed incomes by categories.

The last part of the analysis is about employees. In the table I want show all important informations about company employees. You can modify that by few 
slicers to faster finding informations what you need.

All codes in SQL you can find in file "Codes". Visual analysys with charts, tables etc. you can find in "Visualizations".
I hope you are enjoyed of this project and you contact me.
